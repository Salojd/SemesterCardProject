Playing Cards 24 Game. \n
This application randomly generates four different cards from a deck. The deck contains four suits which includes clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades. Each card contains a numbered value. For example, the value of Ace no matter which suit is picked is 1, the value of two of whichever suit is 2, Queen is 12, King is 13, etc. The objective of this game is to use these four randomly generated cards to implement them into a math equation that results in the value of 24. You can either add, subtract, multiply, or divide when creating a math equation.


Direction to use program
 Make sure you are using JDK9- 
  in Project  > Properties > Libraries > Compile add library for classpath(Javafx) > Run add library for moudule(Javafx)
                            > Run > VM options "--add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.base,javafx.fxml"
                            > Finish(click okay)


Tutorial
Run the application.
Recognize the value of each card displayed in the GUI.
Create a math equation using these four cards and input it inside the "Enter an expression" text field.
Click verify to see whether the input you entered equals to 24 or not.
If successful you should see feedback next to feedback label that confirms you are correct.
If unsuccessful you should see feedback next to feedback label that informs you that the equation used is incorrect.
Assuming you are unable to create a math equation using the four cards displayed, you can click on "Find Solution" and a math equation will be generated for you inside the text field on top. You can then input the generated math equation and repeat step 4.
Click "Refresh" to generate four different cards so you can play again.
Have fun!
